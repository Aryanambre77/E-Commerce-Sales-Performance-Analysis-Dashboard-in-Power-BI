# E-Commerce-Sales-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard-in-Power-BI
Interactive Power BI dashboard for E-commerce sales analysis, featuring state-wise trends, category insights, payment mode breakdown, and profit tracking using advanced visualizations and DAX calculations.

This project presents a fully interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes the sales performance of an E-commerce store. The dashboard delivers data-driven insights on sales distribution across states, product categories, payment modes, and customer segments. It also tracks key performance indicators such as Total Sales Amount, Profit, Quantity Sold, and Average Order Value (AOV), helping stakeholders make informed business decisions.

By using dynamic filters, slicers, and drill-down features, users can explore the data from different perspectives—such as quarter-wise or state-wise performance. The dashboard integrates multiple datasets, undergoes data cleaning and transformation, and leverages DAX calculations to create accurate and actionable metrics.
